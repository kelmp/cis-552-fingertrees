# FingerTree.hs
- Implement all stubs
- Add more functionalities from older paper

# PriorityQueue.hs
- Implement all stubs
- Refactor to eliminate max/min (single PQ is max and min, just choose which end to remove from)

# Sequence.hs
- Implement all stubs

# Benchmark.hs
- Implement benchmark suite from article in Stephanie's email
- Benchmark FingerTree operations compared to List, Seq, (maybe other stuff too?)

# Tests.hs
- Fill in unit tests
- Add QuickCheck properties that aren't from HW5
    - Possibly make these test props of PQ and Sequence in addition to FingerTree

# Application (Main.hs?)
- Come up with heavily random-access use case that would benefit from FingerTrees
- Implement said use case
